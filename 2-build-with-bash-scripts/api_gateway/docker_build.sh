# Script to build the API Gateway Docker image
# This script demonstrates a simple approach to Docker image building
# that will later be refactored into CI/CD pipelines

# Set variables

IMAGE_TAG="latest"

# Display build information

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t ${IMAGE_NAME}:${IMAGE_TAG} ../../api_gateway

# Check if build was successful
